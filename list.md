#HOUSE
- Don't buy stuff that you don't need
  - The average houshold has 300.000 separate items. All those items were created and transported there at a cost.
- Don't replace things that aren't broken, just because they are old
  - Your old phone still works fine, it does everything you need, the screen isn't even damaged yet? Just hold on to it. Don't give in to marketing telling you that you need an upgrade.
- Be careful to not damage and break things that would then need replacing
  -
- Try repairing or replacing parts before replacing the whole item
  -
- Have less lawn
  -
- Grow edible stuff around your house
- Make a green roof
  - A green roof will absorb rain water, which helps offload the sewer, it creates a local cooling effect, which boosts efficiency of solar panels
  -
- Get solar panels
- Get a heat pump
- Insulate your home: double glass in windows, filling in walls, fiberglass on attic, draft blocking foam around doors, reflective foil behind heaters
- Have a water barrel
- Have a steel bike instead of carbon





#STUFF
- Get recycled paper for your printer
- Use backside of papers for notes before throwing them away (into the paper bin)
- Replace inefficient lighting and devices (but only if the old ones break on their own)
- Replace gas powered cooking and heating devices



#HABITS
- Use a cup instead of sipping water from the fosset
- Run cold water if you need cold water.
  - If you need just a squirt of cold water, then both the cold and warm taps will give you cold water. But the warm tap will trigger the heater to run and use up energy unnecesserily
- In winter, keep heating down and just wear an extra layer of clothing
-


- Wash big loads of laundry
- Take colder showers
- Take shorte showers
- Fly as little as possible

- Don't light pollute at night
- Donate to environmental causes (savory institute, eden project)
- Do banking and insure, etc. with companies that invest into the environemnt
- Take staircase instead of elevator
- When cooking, use a lid / pressure cooker

-



#FOOD
- Don't eat as many animal products in general. Start by having less beef, then sheep, then pork, then cheese
- Try to waste less food





- Eat locally grown, endigenous, seasonal produce
- If you are in a cold country (like Netherlands or higher), eat imported citrus fruits, paprika's etc. as it is more carbon efficient to import then to grow locally




- Recycle glass, paper, plastic, metals, fabrics, etc.
- Don't leave fridge door open too long. think of the thing you want, grab it, close door
- Don't leave stuff in the fridge / freezer just for the sake of it. it takes energy to keep it cold
- Use phone to check mail, not a desktop pc
- Turn off light and devices in rooms that you aren't in
- Insulate your home
- Use energy efficient devices
